# Lavalink Example

*You must enter a token as the first argument. As the second argument, you must specify the ip and port of the lavalink server (IP:Port). The third argument is the password for the lavalink server.*

To get the bot up and running, run the following command:

```
dotnet run <someBotTokenHere> <lavalinkHost> <lavalinkPass>
```
